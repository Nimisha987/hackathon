# CuraCare – AI-Enabled Healthcare Support System
## Problem Statement

India continues to face a significant healthcare gap, particularly in semi-urban and rural regions. Limited access to qualified doctors, language barriers, insufficient health infrastructure, and the lack of electronic health records make early diagnosis, consultation, and follow-up care inefficient and inaccessible.

##  Our Mission

**CureCare** aims to bridge this gap by leveraging AI and machine learning to make diagnostics and medical consultation more accessible, efficient, and affordable for all.
